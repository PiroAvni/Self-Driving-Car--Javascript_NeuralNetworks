Using mordern Javascript features and artificial neural network we was able to implement a self driving car simulator.

# What are Neural Networks

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics
the way the human brain operates. 
In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

Example of Neural Network
